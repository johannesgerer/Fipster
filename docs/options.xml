         without deltaHedging, the optimal hedging position is
         determined and used

         todoPerformace: currently the program will calculate the results for
         all hedging ratios and then use only the one closest to
         delta. the only reason was to save time on implementation.

         delta hedging is disabled for exercise=never arguments.
